# LINUX-BASH-SCRIPT

# This project is a project for a faculty assignment and shows some requirements that a user could use in Linux, from unarchiving and archiving to downloading certain files by entering the link to the intended site. It was a team project, 3 students to be exact, where we had the chance to share the tasks equally and manage all the issues so that we were on schedule with a well done project.
